# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio, created using Bootstrap, vanilla HTML and CSS, to showcase previous, and future, web development work.

This repo, and it's linked deployed site, provides an easily-accessible reference, for both myself and others, to see what I have worked on, my progress over time, and how I might approach similar projects in the future.

## Usage

The repo is deployed on GitHub Pages, and can be viewed by clicking [**here**](https://agia.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio), which will take you to the live site in it's most current iteration.

Below are screenshots of the deployed site, at different viewport sizes, which gives an overview of the sites appearance, and demonstrates some of the responsive changes.

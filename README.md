# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio, created using Bootstrap, vanilla HTML and CSS, to showcase previous, and future, web development work.

This repo, and it's linked deployed site, provides an easily-accessible reference, for both myself and others, to see what I have worked on, my progress over time, and how I might approach similar projects in the future.

## Usage

The repo is deployed on GitHub Pages, and can be viewed by clicking [**here**](https://agia.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/), which will take you to the live site in it's most current iteration.

Below are screenshots of the deployed site, at different viewport sizes, which gives an overview of the sites appearance, and demonstrates some of the responsive changes.

## Credits

Thanks to [Placehold](https://placehold.co) for their fine customizable placeholder images, which have put to good use in making the portfolio section look far less barren.

Thanks also to the following for the icons used in the Contact section:

- [Simple Line Icons](https://simplelineicons.github.io/)

Final thanks to Ian Lunn and the collection of box-shadow effects found in [Hover.css](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover/), which I used to add the delightful grow effect to the avatar/logo.
